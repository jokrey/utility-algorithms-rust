# utility-algorithms-rust

Multi purpose utility algorithms.
The algorithms and classes are all each cool, (duh)
   but each not big enough for their own repository.

Some of the algorithms here are implementations of protocols that exist in other "utility-algorithms-*lang*" repos.


How to use:

  For now just copy the whole package into your Project and import it over the Cargo.toml using a path dependency.
  Maybe I'll upload this to crates at some point.
